"""detect_guard.py — runtime-agnostic web-defense probe for keelwright.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The old Web Guard rule said "the agent MUST run verify_web_guard.py before any
web call". That was an instruction, not a mechanism — subagents and kanban
workers (which do NOT inherit the parent's loaded skills) never ran it, and the
operator was never actually told when protection was offline. This probe fixes
both gaps: it is a *script* (callable from any runtime, any subprocess, any
subagent via execute_code) that returns a single machine-readable verdict, and
the skill text now REQUIRES the agent to surface that verdict to the operator
when it is not ACTIVE.

WHAT IT CHECKS (no single-runtime assumptions)
----------------------------------------------
We do NOT hardcode a vendor plugin path or a vendor module name — every agent
runtime (Hermes, OpenClaw, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Kilo) loads its web-defense
plugin differently. Instead we probe what is actually observable from the
interpreter that runs the agent:

Layer 1 — ML / plugin classifier (best protection):
    The well-known classifier dependencies (transformers + torch + sentencepiece)
    are importable in this interpreter. If present, the classifier CAN run; the
    agent then confirms it answers correctly by running `verify_web_guard.py`
    (which performs a safe-vs-injection smoke test). We never auto-download the
    model here — that is an explicit operator-approved step (see "Operator
    onboarding" in references/web-guard.md): the agent MUST ask before any
    ~700MB download begins.

Layer 2 — Heuristic backstop (always-available floor):
    web_heuristic_guard.py ships INSIDE this skill. If it is present next to
    this script, the agent at least has a dependency-free marker scanner.

Layer 3 — External pre-dispatch gate (operator's choice):
    Any skill/plugin the operator wired in (e.g. web-agent-security-gate on
    ClawHub). We do not assume a specific one; the operator enables it per their
    runtime's docs.

VERDICT
-------
  ACTIVE      — ML deps present; operator approved + verified the classifier.
  DEGRADED    — no ML classifier, but the heuristic backstop (Layer 2) is present.
                Web trips are NOT fully protected; operator must be told.
  UNPROTECTED — nothing usable. Web trips are forbidden until fixed / confirmed.

Exit code mirrors the verdict: 0 = ACTIVE, 1 = DEGRADED, 2 = UNPROTECTED.
The stdout message is plain language so an agent can paste it to the operator
verbatim. Nothing here writes files, installs packages, or downloads models.
