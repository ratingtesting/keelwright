bootstrap_l4.py — keelwright Layer-4 auto-wake.

WHY: keelwright's Phoenix + Autoresearch (cross-session learning, L4) need three
files in the PROJECT ROOT:
  - PROGRESS.md
  - autoresearch-lessons.md
  - phoenix-log.md
Without them L4 is inert. Vibe-coders do not read skill files, so we cannot rely on
the agent "remembering" to create them. This script makes it mandatory: the agent
runs it on first skill load, and the files appear.

WHAT IT DOES:
  - Takes one arg: the project root (directory of the repo / open project).
  - For each of the 3 files, if missing, copies the matching template from the
    skill's references/bootstrap/ dir into the project root.
  - If a file already exists, leaves it alone (never overwrites human/agent work).
  - Prints a short plain-language report of what it did.

USAGE: this is invoked by the agent at skill-load time, not by a human.
