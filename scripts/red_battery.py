"""Run RED-BATTERY: swap implementation under test and verify tests fail on buggy version.

RED-BATTERY is the machine proof for gate 8c (spec-not-code / non-tautological tests):
the SAME spec-derived test suite must be GREEN on a correct implementation and RED on a
deliberately buggy one. If both arms are green, the tests do not discriminate and are
tautological by construction.

Usage:
    python scripts/red_battery.py <tests.py> <correct_impl.py> <buggy_impl.py>

All three files must live in the SAME directory; the test module imports `implementation`.
Paths may be relative to the current working directory.

Exit codes:
    0 = PASS         (green on correct, red on buggy — tests discriminate)
    1 = FAIL         (green on both — tautological)
    2 = INCONCLUSIVE (tests do not pass even on the correct implementation, or usage error)
